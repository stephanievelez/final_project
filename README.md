This project has the performance of 354 basketball teams for 5 seasons in data form. 
My goal was to calculate which team is more likely to make it into the Final Four according to their respective performance.

The following classification algorithms were used on the data:
k-Nearest Neighbour
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression
The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when applicable:
Jaccard index
F1-score
Accuracy
Log Loss
